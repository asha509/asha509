### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently enrolled in a class at the University of California, Santa Barbara, studying reproducible research and data science! 

I am interested in learning about the intersection of social psychology and neuroscience. I work at the Social Evaluations and Emotions Lab on campus, as well as do research in this area through the Communication department. 

When not researching, I enjoy cooking, reading science-fiction and fantasy, and playing D&D with my friends :)
